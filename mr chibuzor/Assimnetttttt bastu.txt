 2.10 Assuming that x = 5 and y = 1, what does each of the following statements display?
 a) System.out.printf("x = %d%n", x + 5); 
		"X = 10"
b) System.out.printf("Value of %d *%d is %d\n", x, y, (x * y) ); 
		"VALUE OF 5*1 IS 5"
c) System.out.printf("x is %d and y is %d", x, y); 
		"X IS 5 AND Y IS 1"
d) System.out.printf("%d is not equal to %d\n", (x + y), (x * y) );

 a) int m = (p + 2) + 3; 
b) System.out.println("m = m + 1"); B IS THE ANSER
c) int m = p / 2; 
d) int j = k + 2; 


2.12 Given that y = ax2 + 5x + 2, which of the following are correct Java statements for this equation?
 a) y = a * x * x + 5 * x + 2; TRUE
b) y = a * x * x + (5 * x) + 2;  TRUE
c) y = a * x * x + 5 * (x + 2); 
d) y = a * (x * x) + 5 * x + 2; 
e) y = a * x * (x + 5 * x) + 2;
 f) y = a * (x * x + 5 * x + 2);  TRUE


 2.13 What is the output that will be printed after execution of the following Java code snippet?
 Explain why.
 int p = 5;
 System.out.printf("%d", p + 2 * 4);
 System.out.printf("%d", p * 2 + 4)

For the fist one "13"
the second one the anser is 14 because multiplication have higher precedence

 2.24 (Largest and Smallest Integers) Write an application that reads five integers and determines
 and prints the largest and smallest integers in the group. Use only the programming techniques you
 learned in this chapter.
 2.25 (Divisible by 3) Write an application that reads an integer and determines and prints
 whether it’s divisible by 3 or not. [Hint: Use the remainder operator. A number is divisible by 3 if
 it’s divided by 3 with a remainder of 0.]
 2.26 (Multiples) Write an application that reads two integers, determines whether the first
 number tripled is a multiple of the second number doubled, and prints the result. [Hint: Use the
 remainder operator.]
